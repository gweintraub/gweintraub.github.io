Making a box using dowel joinery on a CNC router. 

Starting by cutting the faces. This is the wide end. Note pockets on each side for a lap joint, and a rabbet joint for the bottom of the box.

")

Narrow end. Matching rabbet, and a handle cut out. Will fillet the edge of handles with hand router.

Found a former knot mid cut. Tiny loss of material. Will be visible in the seam, but it adds character.

Checking for fit. Looks good!

Trying to hammer in the base of the box. Very tight fit.

Too tight!

Recut, with a better fit.
