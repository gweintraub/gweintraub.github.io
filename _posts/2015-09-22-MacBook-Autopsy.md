Apple stopped manufacturing black MacBooks in 2008, so most of the components are effectively useless (although the 500 GB hard drive was a pleasant surprise). The display, however, remains useful, so in to the parts bin it goes. Amazingly, you have to pretty much take apart the entire machine to extract the display.
