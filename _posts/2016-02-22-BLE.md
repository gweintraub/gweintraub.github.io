I took a short course earlier this semester on using Bluetooth Low Energy to control devices, including lights, temperature and motion sensors, as well as wearable and portable devices. For my "final" I built a simple app to connect with and control a stepper motor.

The app is built using PhoneGap (Adobe's framework for creating multi-platform web apps), and connects to the stepper using an RFduino board. The process begins with the app scanning for available BLE devices. The user selects the correct device from a list in order to establish a connection, which opens the detail view. From there, the user can choose a number to send to the Easy Driver board attached to the stepper, which moves the same number of steps.

[Take a look at the source code on GitHub.](https://github.com/gweintraub/BLE-Stepper)
