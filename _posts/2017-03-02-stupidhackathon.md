This past weekend I took part in the 4th annual [Stupid Shit That No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon](https://stupidhackathon.com/), which is a one-day event at NYU where participants make projects that have no value whatsoever. Previous highlights include a Cheez Wiz 3D printer and a Non-Ad Blocker Chrome extension that blocks all content except for ads. I prototyped Illuminated Javascript, a plugin for beautifying code in Sublime Text in the tradition of ancient illuminated manuscripts. I hope it helps make everyone's code seem significantly more cultured and sophisticated.
