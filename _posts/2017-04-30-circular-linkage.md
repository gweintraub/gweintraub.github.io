A little over a year ago as part of my Reinventing the Wheel class I made a simple expanding circular linkage from poster board. I attempted to model it in Fusion 360, but I was still pretty clueless at using joints, and there's a fairly decent chance my dimensions were wrong anyway. Today I dug up a better diagram of the mechanism, and now my CAD assembly finally works. I also think I finally understand how joint limits are supposed to work (not that they're rocket surgery, but the interface has left me confused in the past). Fusion doesn't seem thrilled to work with a circular assembly like this. I wound up scrapping and reconnecting all the joints, and even then it displayed some truly weird behavior, but I finally got it working, so I'm quite pleased with the project.
