<h2>Stuff About Me</h2>

<ul>
	<li>I'm working on my master's degreen at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. It's hard to explain, but it involves studying the very recently possible.</li>
	<li>Currently a Brooklyn resident. I actually grew up outside of Boston, but I was born here in New York, so I claim native status when it's convenient.</li>
	<li>Skidmore College gave me a Bachelor of Science degree in studio art and computer science.</li>
	<li>I'm generally happiest exhausted and covered in sawdust.</li>
	<li>My creative life has been a series of variations on the question, “What does this button do?” and having asked so many times, I’ve come to appreciate really good buttons.</li>
	<li>I watch a grotesque amount of hockey.</li>
	<li>The Seasame Street character I most identify with is Oscar the Grouch.</li>
