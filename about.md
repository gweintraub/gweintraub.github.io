<h2>Stuff About Me</h2>

<ul>
	<li>I'm working on my master's degree at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. It's hard to explain, but it involves a lot of 3D printing.</li>
	<li>Current Brooklyn resident.</li>
	<li>Skidmore College gave me a Bachelor of Science degree in sculpture and computer science.</li>
	<li>I like using tools. Also, breaking tools.</li>
	<li>I'm generally happiest exhausted and covered in sawdust.</li>
	<li>Creatively, I spend most of my time asking, “What does this button do?” and having asked so many times, I’ve come to appreciate really good buttons.</li>
	<li>I watch a grotesque amount of hockey.</li>
	<li>The Sesame Street character I most identify with is Oscar the Grouch.</li>
</ul>
